    "In the previous section, I cleaned the original dataset to ensure that all companies were entered under a single name and had a consistent ticker, segment, industry and country. I then removed any duplicates, transformed any anomalous values in Boolean columns (columns that accept only 0 or 1), and set a base year of 2019. All data prior to 2019 were deleted, new columns were added, and the data frame was divided into a reporting_df and an impact_df. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I analyse the reporting_df, which shows how well each company is meeting their environmental reporting requirements under CSRD (based on the available data we have). It is important to note that CSRD came into force in 2024, but the most recent data in the dataset is from 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first explore the dataset to see how reporting varies from one metric to the next. This might be a useful guide to help understand which services might be in demand in the near future. For example, we see that many companies do not disclose details about water discharges. This may be because they find it hard to measure, and therefore will require help to report that metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use this to run a gap analysis, which shows the percentage of metrics reported...\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I create a score calculator, based on the London Stock Exchange Group's methodology (LSEG, 2024), to give each company an environmental score for a given year. This score calculator is limited by the data available--the Nordic Compass dataset has around 17 relevant columns for measuring a company's environmental score, whereas LSEG used 68 metrics to constitute an environmental score. I also have a limited number of companies in some industries, so it's unreasonable to give an industry-specific score in those industries. Some industries, therefore, have been merged with others. This trade-off would not be required if the dataset was larger. My system is a simplified version, but can be useful for measuring a company's progress on environmental issues and determining companies that are performing well and not so well relative to their competitors.\n",

    "Congrats! You have reached the last Part of this Sprint. In this Part, you will need to use all that you learned in this and previous Sprints. As the final assignment of this Sprint, you will analyse the Coursera Course Dataset. You will have to apply all that you have learned about Data Visualization & Data Analysis to complete this task. You'll notice that in this project you have fewer explicitly stated requirements. Our expectation is that you'll use your own judgement how to perform the analysis and how to select the most important avenues of exploration. You'll have to iteratively raise hypotheses and use your data analysis skills to get answers.\n",
    "P.S. we don't expect this project to be perfect - you will continue to improve your skills and there will be many projects for you to apply your newly gained skills in the future. For now just use what you have learned and try your best!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives for this Part**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice working with data from Kaggle.\n",
    "- Practice performing basic EDA.\n",
    "- Practice visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn or Plotly.\n",
    "- Practice reading data, performing queries and filtering data using Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download the data from [Coursera Course Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset).\n",
    "- Load the data using Pandas.\n",
    "- Perform data cleaning.\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "- Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.\n",
    "- Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adherence to the requirements. How well did you meet the requirements?\n",
    "- Visualization quality. Did you use charts effectively to visualize patterns in the data? Are your visualizations properly labeled? Did you use colors effectively? Did you adhere to the principle of proportional ink?\n",
    "- Code quality. Was your code well-structured? Did you use the appropriate levels of abstraction? Did you remove commented out and unused code? Did you adhere to the PEP8?\n",
    "- Code performance. Did you use the suitable algorithms and data structures to solve the problems?"

Not all companies are equally affected by every metric, so each company must to determine what environmental factors are material to its operations. (Water discharges, for example, will be far more material for a mining company than for a technology company, and should be weighted accordingly.) I first calculate how material the metric is to each industry. This is done by calculating the mean value of each column. Because we are analysing Boolean columns, the higher the mean, the more companies report on this metric, and therefore the more important (material) this must be to the industry. "

    "I calculate the mean using values from 2019 to 2022, rather than calculating the mean for each year. The result will be used to assign materiality weights to each metric, so this method allows each metric to have the same weight from year to year, making it easier to compare companies across years. If I calculated the mean for each year, the materiality weight for each metric would vary from one year to the next, making it harder to determine whether a company has made progress from year to year.\n",

This is something to consider when data is added to the database in future. LSEG (2024) calculates all weights against the latest data available for all companies; this is the best method in theory, but in practice the Nordic Compass database does not have enough data for each industry to rely only on the most recent year of data to set a benchmark.\n"

I decided this was more suitable as a relative measure, rather than comparing to other company scores across all years. However, one potential downside is that some companies have a higher overall_raw_score but lower overall_adjusted_score than others. This is because the performance of other companies in that year will have been higher, dragging down the company's percentile score."
