    "In the previous section, I cleaned the original dataset to ensure that all companies were entered under a single name and had a consistent ticker, segment, industry and country. I then removed any duplicates, transformed any anomalous values in Boolean columns (columns that accept only 0 or 1), and set a base year of 2019. All data prior to 2019 were deleted, new columns were added, and the data frame was divided into a reporting_df and an impact_df. \n",

    "In this section, I analyse the reporting_df, which shows how well each company is meeting their environmental reporting requirements under CSRD (based on the available data we have). It is important to note that CSRD came into force in 2024, but the most recent data in the dataset is from 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first explore the dataset to see how reporting varies from one metric to the next. This might be a useful guide to help understand which services might be in demand in the near future. For example, we see that many companies do not disclose details about water discharges. This may be because they find it hard to measure, and therefore will require help to report that metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use this to run a gap analysis, which shows the percentage of metrics reported...\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I create a score calculator, based on the London Stock Exchange Group's methodology (LSEG, 2024), to give each company an environmental score for a given year. This score calculator is limited by the data available--the Nordic Compass dataset has around 17 relevant columns for measuring a company's environmental score, whereas LSEG used 68 metrics to constitute an environmental score. I also have a limited number of companies in some industries, so it's unreasonable to give an industry-specific score in those industries. Some industries, therefore, have been merged with others. This trade-off would not be required if the dataset was larger. My system is a simplified version, but can be useful for measuring a company's progress on environmental issues and determining companies that are performing well and not so well relative to their competitors.\n",

    "6) Now take the sector score for every company in that sector and calculate the percentile. That will give the company's adjusted_sector_score = This can be considered the company's sector-specific E(SG) score.\n",
    "--The advantage of this is that you can compare scores within a sector across years. But then we have a problem when we add another year. Should we use the base year of 2019 as the calculator? But things might have become more prioritised in recent years. So maybe best to stick with overall.\n",
